# React Application

## Purpose

Creating a responsive interface of a GitHub profile that follows good UX principles, using [React Typescript](https://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and the [official GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch repositories per user.\
This interface allows the user to filter through the repositories by name, consult the GitHub profile and open a repository. \
You can check the deployed application [here](https://github-repository-app.netlify.app/).

## Future Improvements

- Adding a pagination for repositories
- Improving the design
- Adding a filter for GitHub profiles by username
- Using the v4 API
